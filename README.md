Solo Project with Scrimba

Great project to get back in to code after a few weeks of. Happy tha I remembered alot from memory. 
Got stuck with code not working to realise that I missed the camelcase of varaible and that was not allowig the code to excute. 
Learning wass 3 dots underword with missing camelcase in VS code gave indication where issue was. this realisaion will now speed up coding bugs.

Main focus from project was on adding numbers to panel using innerHtml,eventlistners for clicks & reseting panels to zero for re-counting.
